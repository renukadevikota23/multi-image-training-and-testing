# Multi-User Interface for Training and Testing

## 📌 Project Description

This project provides a **multi-user interface** for collaborative or individual **training and testing of machine learning models**. Designed for research, experimentation, and educational purposes, the interface enables multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously—each with their own session for training models on custom datasets or testing with various inputs.

## 💡 Features

* 🔐 **User Authentication** – Secure login and session management for multiple users.
* 🧠 **Model Training Interface** – Upload datasets, configure model parameters, and train models with real-time feedback.
* 🧪 **Testing Module** – Test trained models with new input data and view performance metrics.
* 📊 **Results Dashboard** – Visualize training and testing results including accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and more.
* ⏳ **Session Persistence** – Each user’s progress and models are saved between sessions.
* 📁 **Dataset Management** – Users can upload, view, and manage their own datasets.
* ⚙️ **Model Selection** – Support for multiple model architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM, Random Forest).
* 🌐 **Web-Based UI** – Accessible via any modern browser with responsive design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: React.js / Vue.js / HTML + CSS + JS
* **Backend**: Python (Flask / Django / FastAPI)
* **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch / Scikit-learn
* **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB / SQLite
* **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth
* **Deployment**: Docker / Heroku / AWS / Local server

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-user-ml-interface.git
   cd multi-user-ml-interface
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   # In backend directory
   python app.py

   # In frontend directory
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Usage

* **Register/Login** to start your session.
* Navigate to the **Train** tab to upload your dataset and configure training.
* Use the **Test** tab to evaluate the model with new data.
* Monitor performance on the **Dashboard** tab.
* Export model and results as needed.

## 👥 Multi-User Management

Each user account maintains:

* Custom datasets
* Trained model instances
* Individual training history and logs

Admin access enables:

* User monitoring and control
* Dataset approvals (if applicable)
* Model sharing between users
